# Calculating cross-sectional area, wetted perimetre and hydraulic radius of a stream/channel.
  
* Area:             cross-sectional area of flow (m^2^)
* Wetted Perimeter: length of wetted contact between water and the stream bed along a cross-sectional transect (m)
* Hydraulic Radius: Area/Wetted Perimeter

*This script should work for stream cross section shapes including rectangle, trapezoid and triangle.*
   
      
   
**Input** - "Stream_input_D&W.csv"   
Width across the bank (W) in meters and depth (D) in meters for n number of transects along the stream are required

**Output** - "stream_output.csv"
